# DTT-MazeGenerator

I want to make a maze generator using the Detph-first search algorithm. Why this algorithm and not another one. Simple reason, I think it looks the coolest.

## Features i want in 
* Maze generation
* UI where you can change the width, height and you can  regenerate the maze
* change camera depending on the mazes size

## Features that would be nice(Low Priority but are still realy fun)
* Having a player that can walk around
* able to play from a first person perspactive of the player and back
* Particle effects for when you finish the maze
* particle effects for when a new
